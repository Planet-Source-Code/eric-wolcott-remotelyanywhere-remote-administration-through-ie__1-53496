### Description

This is a replica of the RemotelyAnywhere program. This is unfinished.... i put a lot of functions into this project. The filemanager and the command prompt work. The this program is started on a computer you can connect to it through Internet Explorer simply by typing in the IP address to that machine.... After doing so a loging screen will be displayed.... this in return will allow you to browse that computer. There is a great layout included in this along with Javascript and vb script..... please tell me what you think and feel free to add more onto this project....
